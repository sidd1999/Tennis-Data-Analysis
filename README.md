**Main Goals**

**Do the top players perform better on any specific type of playing surface, and what effect does the surface have on the total score? For games played between right-handed and left-handed players,
what is the percentage of victories for each handedness on different court types?**
Sports brands like Nike and Under Armour rely heavily on data-driven insights to optimize their products and performance. This question explores how insights gathered from analyzing playing surfaces can guide the development of innovative and effective sports equipment, specifically focusing on tennis players. Playing surfaces can significantly impact players' performance in various ways. Understanding these impacts is crucial for sports brands to develop equipment that delivers optimal performance across different surfaces.
By understanding the nuances of each surface, brands can create equipment that maximizes performance. For example, developing shoes with improved traction for clay courts or lighter rackets for faster surfaces. By leveraging data-driven insights from playing surfaces, sports brands can develop highly effective and personalized equipment that empowers athletes to excel across all playing conditions. This approach not only boosts player performance but also strengthens brand reputation and drives competitive advantage.

**How significantly does a player's age impact their game performance, and can we associate the success of younger players and the difficulties faced by older players with factors like stamina and match duration?**
This question explores how data-driven insights derived from player performance can benefit three key stakeholders:
Telecasting Networks: Analyze factors like age, stamina, and match duration to determine their impact on viewership and optimize scheduling decisions.
DraftKings (Betting Company): Utilize insights to make informed decisions about player performance and assess the viability of betting on certain players, particularly older athletes.
Sports Fans: Gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing player performance and match complexity, leading to a more engaging and informed viewing experience.
Imagine analyzing data across various age groups and revealing that younger players tend to perform better in shorter matches, while older players excel in longer, more strategic matches.
These insights can be used by our clients in the following ways:
Telecasting Networks to schedule shorter matches featuring younger players during peak viewing hours to attract a larger audience.
DraftKings where they can increase betting odds on older players in longer matches based on their predicted performance.
Sports Fans can gain a deeper understanding of why certain players perform better under specific circumstances, making their viewing experience more insightful.

**During the clash of the Legends i.e Djokovic/ Nadal or Djokovic/Federer or Federer/Nadal, which player proved to be a winner majority of the time against their opponent? Based on the overall success ratio, 
success ratio geographically and the type of surface, generate insights which player can be most reliable for brand sponsorships?**
Sponsorship companies such as Lactose and Sergio Tacchini will want to sponsor a player that has meaning to the brand. Knowing which tournament a player wins the most will allow the brand who is from that area to decide which player they should associate with.
Sports entertainment companies like our clients ESPN and BIeN Sports will need the most reliable information about the top players when they are reporting and debating tennis matches. The anchors will be able to tell a story on how a certain player wins more or if the players are a tie most of the time. This will differentiate the broadcasters from different sports channels. The differentiation will help bring in viewers because the anchors are providing more information on the players and relating back to historical data that the analysis will provide.

**Does the number of aces (ace means when a serve is in but not hit at all by the receiving player) served by a player in a game directly depend on the outcome? (more aces = winner)? Why is that so?**
Betting companies like our client DraftKings Sportsbook can provide historical data of a player's game in order to help betters make precise decisions for the future. Knowing the pattern history of how often a winner or a loser has an ace will allow better to know who has a higher probability of winning the game. By providing this information it will make the betting process more efficient and will attract more betters to DraftKings Sportsbook.

**Which player has a higher probability of winning the game based on features like total number of aces, number of breakpoints saved by the winner, 
number of breakpoints saved by the loser and the type of playing surface?**
Using predictive machine learning models like RandomForestClassifier, we will try to simulate a match between 2 players and predict the winner. We will train the model on features like - Total number of Aces, Total Breakpoints saved by Winner and Loser and The Type of Surface. After executing the model, we find a 99% accuracy and a prediction of the winner.
